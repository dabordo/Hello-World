# Project Title
Hello-World

## Description
During this assignment I used LinkedIN Learning and professor Kristine Arens instruction to create my **first** repository.

### The Process
1. Study the basics through LinkedIN Learning
2. Create my repository and ReadMe file
3. Update my ReadMe file with relevant information
4. Practice different sytnax options

#### Next Steps
This semester I am working on multiple BAIS projects at UIowa. My courses include:

- Accounting Systems and Analytics

In the future I will update my GitHub with relevant projects in BAIS and Finance!
